# `ank`

_Arch New Kernel?_`

is barely a rust program.. it just compares the output of `uname -r` and `pacman -Qe linux` and tells you the conclusion.

## Installation

Download binary or install from source. It will probably be equally fast, as this crate has NO dependencies.

```
cargo binstall ank
```

```
cargo install ank
```
